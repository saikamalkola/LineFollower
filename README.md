# Line Follower Robot
LineFollower using Arduino:
<br>•	Designed  a robot that  follows a black line on white background autonomously based on PID algorithm using an <br>Atmel Atmega-328p microcontroller.
<br>•	Fabricated a 6-sensor IR array to detect black line and Histogram method is used to estimate the line position w.r.t  reference sensor.
